v1.06
	- initial commit

v1.09
  - separated out English vs Welsh enhanced hours because plaintime is different on the 2016 vs 2026 contract
  - made it more obvious which inputs affect the english contract or welsh contract
  - changed the output display slightly

v1.1.0
	- corrected pay premia values. Old version used 2024 values by mistake

v1.1.1
	- added an option to change the comparison table to gross pay, and changed the comparisons to use Wales 2002 as the base.

v1.1.2
	- made the gross/net comparison reactive (not impacted by input changes until calculate is pressed/clicked), and moved it below the calculate button

v1.1.3
	- changed it so if you select that you're a GPST on a GP rotation, it automatically chooses GP pay premia. But if you don't tick the box, you can't have the GP pay premia.
	- moved the GPST rota selection directly below grade selection
