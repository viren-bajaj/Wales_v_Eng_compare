# Wales_v_Eng_compare

This is a hobby project. It is not official from the BMA.

Compares the Welsh 2002 to proposed Welsh 2026 to English 2016 doctor contracts. 

A new contract was negotiated by the welsh resident doctors comittee (WRDC) and NHS wales. DOI - I'm on the committee as of October 2025, but joined after the contract negotiation was concluded. This project was drafted after the contract details were made public.

the main points of the new contract are a move away from banding to paying for hours worked, plus an out of hours enhancement of 1.5x. 

The new contract retains incremental credit, but adjusts the pay scales to have 5 ST pay nodes rather than 10. 

This project can calculate NHS pension deductions, but I offer no pension advice. The only clarification that is still required regarding pensions is whether NHS pension deductions affect gross imcome for the purpose of calculating student loan deductions.

The project can also calculate student loan deductions. 

If required I can add in code for scottish taxpayers (this exists in one of my other repositories), however this is unlikely to be necessary simce the purpose if this particular calculator is to assess welsh pay, and it is extremely unlikely someone would be resident in Scotland whilst on Welsh pay.

Live version of calculator (v1.0.9): https://virenb.shinyapps.io/Welsh_v_English_contract_compare/

v1.0.9 has an error (wrong pay premia data for England), pls use v1.1.0 or newer if you want to use this as basis for your own code for 2025-26 

toDo:
make the premia selection less ugly
add LTFT (need to clarify how LTFT works on the prposed contract before it is added back in, else I'll have errors)
