# Wales_v_Eng_compare
Compares the Welsh 2002 contract to proposed Welsh 2026 contract to English 2016 contract

This is a hobby project, it is not offical BMA at all

toDo:
make the premia selection less ugly
add LTFT (need to clarify how LTFT works on the prposed contract before it is added back in, else I'll have errors)
