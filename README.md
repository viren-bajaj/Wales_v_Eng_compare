# Wales_v_Eng_compare
Compares the Welsh 2002 to proposed Welsh 2026 to English 2016 doctor contracts. 

A new contract was negotiated by the welsh resident doctors comittee (WRDC) and NHS wales. 

the main points of the new contract are a move away from banding to paying for hours worked, plus an out of hours enhancement of 1.5x. 

the new contract retains incremental credit, but adjusts the pay scales to have 5 ST pay nodes rather than 10. 

This is a hobby project

Live version of calculator (v1.0.9): https://virenb.shinyapps.io/Welsh_v_English_contract_compare/

v1.0.9 has an error (wrong pay premia data for England), pls use v1.1.0 or newer if you want to use this as basis for your own code for 2025-26 

toDo:
make the premia selection less ugly
add LTFT (need to clarify how LTFT works on the prposed contract before it is added back in, else I'll have errors)
